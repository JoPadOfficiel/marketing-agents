Generate blog post titles for the following project:

- Project Type: {{ project.type }}
- Project Summary: {{ project.summary }}
- Blog Theme: {{ project.blog_theme }}
- Key Features: {{ project.key_features }}

Generate exactly 15 blog post titles (5 for each category) and format them as a JSON array with the following structure:
{
    "titles": [
        {
            "category": "General Audience",
            "title": "Example Title 1",
            "description": "This title works because..."
        },
        {
            "category": "Niche Audience",
            "title": "Example Title 2",
            "description": "This title works because..."
        },
        {
            "category": "Industry/Company",
            "title": "Example Title 3",
            "description": "This title works because..."
        }
    ]
}

Ensure each title:
1. Is specific and clear about what the reader will learn
2. Includes numbers where appropriate
3. Creates curiosity without being clickbait
4. Promises value or solution to a problem
5. Is timeless rather than time-sensitive
6. Uses power words to enhance appeal

Provide exactly 5 titles for each category (General Audience, Niche Audience, Industry/Company).
Return only valid JSON, no additional text or explanations outside the JSON structure.
