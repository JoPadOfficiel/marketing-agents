Generate a single SEO-optimized blog post title and format it as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "title": "SEO-Optimized Title Here",
    "category": "For example: General Audience, Technical, Business, Marketing, Product Updates, Case Studies, Industry News, How-To, Feature Spotlight",
    "target_keywords": ["Primary Keyword", "Secondary Keyword", "Long-tail Keyword"],

3. Uses power words that drive clicks
4. Maintains readability while being search-engine friendly
5. Addresses user search intent
6. Includes numbers or specific data where relevant
7. Creates curiosity without being clickbait
8. Matches search patterns for the target audience
9. Aligns with the project's industry and type
