Generate SEO-optimized blog post titles and format them as a JSON array with the following structure:
{
    "titles": [
        {
            "title": "Example Title 1",
            "category": "",
            "target_keywords": ["Keyword 1", "Keyword 2"],
            "description": "This title works because...",
            "suggested_meta_description": "160-character meta description for the blog post"
        }
    ]
}

Ensure each title:
1. Contains primary keyword near the beginning
2. Is between 50-60 characters long
3. Uses proven CTR-boosting patterns (how-to, numbers, questions, etc.)
4. Addresses specific search intent
5. Includes power words that enhance click-through rates
6. Maintains natural readability while being SEO-friendly
7. Avoids keyword stuffing
8. Uses modifiers like "best", "guide", "tips", where appropriate

The seo_score should be calculated based on:
- Keyword placement (30%)
- Title length optimization (20%)
- Click-through potential (25%)
- Search intent match (25%)

Return only valid JSON, no additional text or explanations outside the JSON structure.
